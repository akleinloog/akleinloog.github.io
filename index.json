You are currently looking at the result of this!\nThe What The basic idea was to set up a blog where I can easily manage my posts and provide some info on myself and the projects I work on. Having played around with Wordpress in the past, I wanted something different this time.\nMy main requirements:\n Easy to use (for me) Easy to host Free of costs (no licence or hosting fees) Learn something new in the process  The Why My main motivation is to have a place to keep track of the many technical experiments I do and their outcomes. A blog that allows me to write small posts, tag them, and easily search through them seemed like a good solution.\nIf others can also find these experiments and learn from them, that would be an additional benefit. And if they in turn can provide feedback, even better.\nThe How After looking around a bit I decided to try out the following:\n Use Hugo, a Static Site Generator written in Go Write the content in markdown Use a GitHub repository to keep the sources Use another GitHub repository to host the resulting blog Open Source the result so others might learn from it  The Results The current state of this project is open for all to see. Look around and take a look at the sources if you are interested.\nThis is still a work in progress, I will add some posts that detail what I did and what I used, and hope to add some additional features soon, for example, the possibility for others to comment.\nI hope you will find this useful somehow!\n","date":1588636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588636800,"objectID":"8174ecd8e0648e049ff264ac750633bb","permalink":"/project/personal-blog/","publishdate":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/personal-blog/","section":"project","summary":"A simple website to be used as a personal blog.","tags":["Open Source","Hugo"],"title":"Personal Blog","type":"project"},{"authors":["Arnoud Kleinloog"],"categories":["Test"],"content":"This is just a simple test post to see if everything is working correctly.
