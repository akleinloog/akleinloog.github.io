It details the basic set up that is needed to get started.\nI use Hugo as a static site generator and Visual Studio Code as editor. The resulting website is hosted using GitHub Pages. A nice combination of open source tools with a free hosting provider that poses no restrictions in terms of traffic, size, etc. Sounds like a perfect match to me.\nFamiliarity with git and the command line are assumed. I use a Mac,en some of the commands may need to be translated to your environment.\nGetting started Following this Hugo tutorial, I created two repositories on GitHub. One named website for the sources, and another one for the generated website.\n The name of the repository for the generated website has to be specific in order for it to be picked up by GitHub Pages. In my case: akleinloog.github.io   I decided to dedicate both repositories to the public domain and therefore used the UNLICENSE. Feel free to use anything you find here as you see fit.\nThe next step is to clone the repository used for the source:\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;username here\u0026gt;/website.git  And open the project in Visual Studio Code:\ncd website code .  Add the following .gitignore file and optionally, save the code workspace:\n# MacOS Files .DS_Store # Hugo Working Folders resources/  Install Hugo if not already installed:\nbrew install hugo  And initialize your repository for Hugo:\nhugo new site . --force  Select a theme A good overview of available themes can be found here. Select Hugo and order the themes by Stars gives you an overview of the most used themes.\nI decided to try Academic, a feature rich, open source theme developed by George Cushen and made available under the MIT license. Thanks George!\nAdd the theme as a git submodule:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic.git themes/academic  Familiarize yourself with Academic, and customize it as you see fit. A good way to do that, is to clone the Academic Kickstart project in a separate directory. It provides a good demonstration of what the theme has to offer.\nTry it out locally Experiment with the configuration options and the structure. Run the site in development mode using:\nhugo server  The site will be available at http://localhost:1313. Whenever you save your changes, Hugo will pick up on it and automatically refresh it, providing for a pleasant live-editing experience.\nGet ready to publish Add the repository for the generated website as a git submodule:\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/\u0026lt;username here\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;username here\u0026gt;.github.io.git public  Doing so ensures that the HTML and JavaScript generated by Hugo will be placed in that repository.\nFirst, we\u0026rsquo;ll do a manual run. Generate your website:\nhugo -t academic  Test the generated output using the serve package:\ncd public npx serve  Automate it Add a file called deploy.sh to the sources repository\u0026rsquo;s main folder. Ensure it is executable:\nchmod +x deploy.sh  Add the following content to that file:\n#!/bin/sh set -e echo \u0026quot;Cleaning Publish Folder\u0026quot; rm -r ./public/* echo \u0026quot;Running Hugo Build\u0026quot; hugo -t academic cd public echo \u0026quot;Adding changes to git\u0026quot; git add . msg=\u0026quot;regenerating site content $(date)\u0026quot; git commit -m \u0026quot;$msg\u0026quot; echo \u0026quot;Pushing to master\u0026quot; git push origin master cd .. echo \u0026quot;Deployment Finished\u0026quot;  This script uses Hugo to generate your website and commit the changes to the website\u0026rsquo;s repository. By pushing these changes to GitHub, the script effectively deploys your website to production!\nNext Step I hope you have enjoyed this as much as I did, in Part 2 I will add support for Google Analytics, and in later posts I will enable comments and add a simple contact page.\n","date":1588723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588807866,"objectID":"b49638f9d39038b22b0383ee21a254e3","permalink":"https://akleinloog.github.io/post/my-blog-pt1/","publishdate":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/my-blog-pt1/","section":"post","summary":"How to set up a simple blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages.","tags":["Academic","Hugo"],"title":"Setting up this Blog - Part 1","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The goal of this project was to set up a simple website to use as a personal blog. You are currently looking at the result of this!\nThe What The basic idea was to set up a blog where I can easily manage my posts and provide some info on myself and the projects I work on. Having played around with Wordpress in the past, I wanted something different this time.\nMy main requirements:\n Easy to use (for me) Easy to host Free of costs (no licence or hosting fees) Learn something new in the process  The Why My main motivation is to have a place to keep track of the many technical experiments I do and their outcomes. A blog that allows me to write small posts, tag them, and easily search through them seemed like a good solution.\nIf others can also find these experiments and learn from them, that would be an additional benefit. And if they in turn can provide feedback, even better.\nThe How After looking around a bit I decided to try out the following:\n Use Hugo, a Static Site Generator written in Go Write the content in markdown Use a GitHub repository to keep the sources Use another GitHub repository to host the resulting blog Open Source the result so others might learn from it  The Results The current state of this project is open for all to see. Look around and take a look at the sources if you are interested.\nThis is still a work in progress, I will add some posts that detail what I did and what I used, and hope to add some additional features soon, for example, the possibility for others to comment.\nI hope you will find this useful somehow!\n","date":1588636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588714320,"objectID":"8174ecd8e0648e049ff264ac750633bb","permalink":"https://akleinloog.github.io/project/personal-blog/","publishdate":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/personal-blog/","section":"project","summary":"A simple website to be used as a personal blog.","tags":["Open Source","Hugo"],"title":"Personal Blog","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588623963,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://akleinloog.github.io/about/","publishdate":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"About the author","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588625778,"objectID":"475f2249a5c02879faf32697c0e89e6e","permalink":"https://akleinloog.github.io/portfolio/","publishdate":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/portfolio/","section":"","summary":"Some of the projects I have been working on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"}]
